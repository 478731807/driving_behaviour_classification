# LSTM for driving behaviour classification

This is the code repository for our paper, [Driving Behavior Classification Based on Sensor Data Fusion Using LSTM Recurrent Neural Networks](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8317835).  

This repo contains the data and tensorflow code for training and testing the LSTM model we used in the paper. To run this code, it is necessary to have installed:  
- Tensorflow == 0.12
- Numpy
- Sklearn
